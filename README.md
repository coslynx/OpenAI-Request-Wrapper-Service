## AI Powered OpenAI Request Wrapper Service - README.md Implementation Instructions

This comprehensive guide will guide you through implementing the `README.md` file for the AI Powered OpenAI Request Wrapper Service MVP. This file serves as the primary documentation for the project, providing a clear and concise overview for users and developers.

### 1. Project Overview

**1.1. Introduction**

Welcome to the AI Powered OpenAI Request Wrapper Service, a Python-based backend API that simplifies interactions with the OpenAI API. This service aims to democratize access to powerful AI technology by making it easy for developers and businesses to integrate OpenAI models into their applications.

**1.2. Key Features**

The AI Powered OpenAI Request Wrapper Service provides a user-friendly interface for making requests to OpenAI models, including:

- **Request Handling:** The service accepts user requests, specifying the desired OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-3, Codex, DALL-E), the input prompt, and any necessary parameters.
- **API Call Generation:**  The service automatically translates user requests into valid OpenAI API calls that adhere to the OpenAI API specifications.
- **Response Processing:** The service retrieves responses from the OpenAI API and processes them into a structured format for easy understanding.
- **Response Formatting:** The service formats processed responses for display or use in other applications, making them easily digestible.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** The service implements a robust authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 to ensure secure access.

**1.3. Benefits**

This service offers numerous benefits for developers and businesses:

- **Performance:** Streamlined request processing and efficient response handling result in reduced latency and quicker response times.
- **Security:**  Secure authentication and communication with the OpenAI API protect sensitive information and ensure reliable service.
- **Cost-Efficiency:**  Optimized API calls and efficient resource utilization reduce API usage costs.
- **Scalability:**  A flexible architecture designed to handle increasing workloads makes the service adaptable to evolving demands.
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with various applications and frameworks allows for wide applicability across diverse projects.

### 2. Installation and Setup

**2.1. Prerequisites**

To set up and run the AI Powered OpenAI Request Wrapper Service, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.9+:** Ensure you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed on your system.
- **PostgreSQL:**  The service requires PostgreSQL as its database. You may need to install PostgreSQL if it's not already available on your system.
- **OpenAI API Key:**  Obtain an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website. You can find the instructions [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

**2.2. Installation Steps**

Follow these steps to install and configure the service:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coslynx/OpenAI-Request-Wrapper-Service.git
    cd OpenAI-Request-Wrapper-Service
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    - Update the following environment variables in the `.env` file with your specific values:
        - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL database connection string.
        - `OPENAI_API_KEY`:  Your OpenAI API key.
        - `JWT_SECRET`:  A secret key for JWT token generation.

4. **Create the Database:**
    ```bash
    createdb openai_wrapper
    psql -U user -d openai_wrapper -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;"
    ```

5. **Start the Service:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

### 3. Usage Guide

**3.1. Making OpenAI Requests**

Here's how to make requests to OpenAI models using the service:

1. **Choose a Model:** Select the desired OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `text-davinci-003`) for your request. 
2. **Formulate a Prompt:**  Write a clear and concise prompt that describes what you want the model to generate.
3. **Specify Parameters (Optional):**  Use optional parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `max_tokens`) to control the model's behavior.
4. **Send the Request:**  Send the request to the API endpoint `/requests/create` using your preferred method, such as `curl`.

**Example using curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "prompt": "Write a short poem about a cat.", "parameters": {"temperature": 0.7}}' \
  http://localhost:8000/requests/create
```

**3.2. User Authentication**

The service provides basic user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. Here's how it works:

1. **Register a New User:**
    - Send a `POST` request to the `/users/register` endpoint to register a new user account. You'll need to provide a username, email, and password.

2. **Login:**
    - Send a `POST` request to the `/users/login` endpoint to log in to your account. You'll need to provide your username and password. Upon successful login, you'll receive a JWT access token.

3. **Using the Access Token:**
    - Include the JWT access token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests using the `Bearer` scheme. For example:

    ```bash
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN 
    ```
